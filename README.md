**A collection of miscellaneous config files used in various places.**

`starship.toml` is the configuration file for the starship shell prompt. By default, it needs to be placed in `$HOME/.config/`, but the path can be redefined in something like `.bashrc` with: 

```
export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/example/non/default/path/starship.toml
```
